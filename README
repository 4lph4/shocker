Changes in version 0.4
* Introduced a thread count limit defaulting to 10
* Removed colour support until I can figure out how to make it work in\
    Windows and *nix equally well
    * Spelling corrections
    * More comprehensive cgi_list
    * Removes success_flag from output

    TODO

    Add some slightly more useful exploitation options. (Shells?)
    Support for multiple hosts via a file switch on the command line?
    Save results to a file? Format?
    * Eventually the idea is to include multiple possible vectors but currently\
        only one is checked.
        Implement some form of progress indicator for slow tasks
        Fix problem with proxy returning 200 for unavailable URLs/false positives
        Pass a URL on the command line to replace cgi_list (or in addition to?)
        Prettify
        Other stuff. Probably.
